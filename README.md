# SQL-Project----Energy-Consumption

## Introduction
The global energy sector requires effective management of energy production, consumption, emissions, and GDP categories.
Efficient data handling helps track energy usage and generation, monitor resource availability, and analyze sustainability performance.
This project simulates a worldwide energy database with interconnected entities such as energy consumption, production, emissions, GDP, and population.
It offers hands-on experience in understanding data relationships and global economicâ€“environmental interactions.
Students will use SQL to extract and transform data, gaining valuable insights into energy trends.
The goal is to improve decision-making and sustainability planning through data-driven analysis.

The energy sector generates large data on production, consumption, emissions, and resources.

Managing this data is important for sustainability and decision-making.

The project designs a relational database to capture and organize energy sector activities.

SQL is used to analyze data and extract key insights (top consumers, producers, emission trends).

It also builds SQL skills like joins, aggregations, subqueries, and filtering.

## Conclustion:
The project analyzes global energy data on production, consumption, emissions, GDP, and population.

A relational database was designed to organize and connect this information.

SQL queries were used to extract insights on energy use, emissions, and economic trends.

The study shows how GDP and population growth impact sustainability.

Combines SQL skills with real-world energy and environmental planning.
